| **Aspect**                        | **Copilot Studio**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **M365 Copilot**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **SharePoint Agents**                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Primary Purpose**               | Build and deploy custom conversational agents (chatbots) tailored to specific workflows, policies, or data sources.                                                                                                                                                                     | Provide AI-powered assistance embedded within Microsoft 365 apps (Word, Excel, Teams, Outlook) for productivity enhancement, document drafting, analysis, and meeting summarization.                                                                                                | Host lightweight Q\&A or task-oriented bots directly within SharePoint pages and libraries, drawing on SharePoint content (lists, libraries, pages) as the knowledge base.                                                         |
| **Deployment Model**              | Provisioned through the Copilot Studio portal; supports cloud-hosted agents that can be embedded in web portals, Teams, or external sites via iframe or SDKs.                                                                                                                           | Embedded natively in Microsoft 365 applications and accessible to licensed users; no separate “agent” deployment is required beyond granting Copilot licenses to users.                                                                                                             | Deployed as a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web part or Power Automate-backed chatbot integrated directly into SharePoint Online pages or Team Sites.                                                                                |
| **Data Sources & Integration**    | • Connects to multiple sources (Azure Cognitive Search, custom APIs, Dataverse, third-party databases).<br>• Can ingest PDFs, policy documents, GIS feeds, case-management systems.                                                                                                     | • Leverages document libraries, lists, and content from SharePoint/OneDrive/Exchange.<br>• Integrates with Excel tables, Word documents, Planner, Outlook mailboxes, and Teams meeting recordings.                                                                                  | • Reads and queries SharePoint lists, libraries, and pages (including custom columns and metadata).<br>• Can invoke Power Automate flows for external APIs or Dataverse lookups, but primarily stays within SharePoint context.    |
| **Customization & Extensibility** | • Fully customizable dialog flows and response logic using no-code/low-code designer.<br>• Support for Adaptive Cards, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with custom knowledge bases.<br>• Connectors to CRM, GIS, or back-end systems.                                              | • Limited to prompting and contextual AI tasks inside M365 apps; no standalone dialog designer.<br>• Extends via Copilot prompts and contextual document/context analysis but not a traditional “bot” designer.                                                                     | • Customizable Q\&A templates for FAQs and knowledge articles.<br>• Supports simple dialog trees. Advanced logic may require Power Automate or Azure Functions.<br>• Can use PnP.js or REST for deeper customization.              |
| **Licensing & Prerequisites**     | • Requires Copilot Studio per-user licenses for “maker” account creation.<br>• Underlying Azure Consumption (Cognitive Services, Storage, Search) may incur additional costs.<br>• End-users do not require extra licenses beyond having access to the host application (web or Teams). | • Requires M365 Copilot license for each end-user who invokes Copilot features in Word, Excel, Teams, or Outlook.<br>• Underlying data must reside within Microsoft 365 (SharePoint, OneDrive, Exchange).                                                                           | • Requires SharePoint Online license (included in most M365 bundles).<br>• If Power Automate is used for advanced logic, additional Power Automate licensing may apply.<br>• No separate “Copilot” license is needed.              |
| **Ideal Scenarios**               | • Citizen-facing portals (e.g., permit-application assistant, emergency resource locator).<br>• Internal policy advisors requiring RAG against large document repositories.<br>• Complex workflows needing custom integrations (e.g., grant-management systems, GIS mapping).           | • Knowledge workers drafting legislation or reports in Word.<br>• Finance teams performing “what-if” scenario analysis in Excel.<br>• Meeting owners needing automated transcription, summary, and task creation in Teams.<br>• Caseworkers triaging constituent emails in Outlook. | • Intranet-based FAQ bot for employees (e.g., HR policies, IT helpdesk).<br>• Document retrieval agent that locates the latest version of a compliance form.<br>• Onboarding guide that tracks progress via SharePoint task lists. |
| **Security & Compliance**         | • Supports Azure AD-based authentication and RBAC.<br>• Data residency and compliance governed by Azure and Microsoft 365 standards.<br>• Requires separate governance policies for custom knowledge bases.                                                                             | • Inherits Microsoft 365 compliance frameworks (e.g., DLP, retention, eDiscovery).<br>• Access controls are managed via M365 permissions; no external data connectors beyond M365 content.                                                                                          | • Inherits SharePoint Online security trimming (site-level and item-level permissions).<br>• Any external calls via Power Automate must be secured with proper connectors and service principals.                                  |
| **Maintenance & Governance**      | • Admin portal to monitor agent usage, retrain or update knowledge bases, manage API keys, and audit logs.<br>• Requires lifecycle governance for connectors and embeddings.                                                                                                            | • Ongoing feature updates managed by Microsoft; administrators only configure tenant-wide settings (e.g., Copilot rollout, privacy controls).                                                                                                                                       | • Governed via SharePoint site-collection administration.<br>• Maintenance involves updating Q\&A content or Power Automate flows, patching SPFx packages, and monitoring site usage.                                              |
